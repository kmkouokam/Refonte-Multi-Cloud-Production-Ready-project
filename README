# Multi-Cloud Terraform Infrastructure

This project provisions a **production-ready multi-cloud infrastructure** using Terraform across **AWS** and **GCP**.  
It follows modular design practices, with reusable modules for VPC, Database, Kubernetes, Security, and Multi-Cloud VPN.

---
## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure & Service Explanations

- **environments/** â€“ Environment-specific Terraform configs  
  - `aws/` â†’ Defines AWS resources such as VPC, EC2, RDS, IAM, and Kubernetes (EKS).  
  - `gcp/` â†’ Defines GCP resources such as VPC, GKE (Kubernetes), Cloud SQL, and IAM policies.  

- **modules/** â€“ Reusable Terraform modules across clouds:
  - `vpc/` â†’ Creates networking layer (VPC, subnets, route tables, NAT gateways, firewalls/security groups). Ensures secure multi-AZ networking.  
  - `db/` â†’ Provisions managed database services (RDS in AWS, Cloud SQL in GCP). Includes HA (multi-AZ) and encrypted storage.  
  - `kubernetes/` â†’ Sets up Kubernetes clusters (EKS in AWS, GKE in GCP). Supports autoscaling, secure node groups, and workload deployment.  
  - `security/` â†’ Manages IAM users, roles, and policies. Configures security groups, service accounts, and encryption keys for least-privilege security.  
  - `multi_cloud_vpn/` â†’ Configures VPN tunnels between AWS and GCP networks to enable secure inter-cloud communication and hybrid workloads.  

- **providers.tf** â€“ Configures the required providers (AWS and GCP credentials).  
- **variables.tf** â€“ Declares input variables for project customization.  
- **outputs.tf** â€“ Exports key infrastructure values (VPC IDs, DB endpoints, cluster names).  
- **terraform-commands.md** â€“ Quick reference for Terraform commands.  
- **terraform_multicloud_full_guide.md** â€“ In-depth guide to deploying and managing the infrastructure.  
- **terraform.tfstate.d/** â€“ Stores Terraform state per environment (AWS/GCP).  
- **Final Cloud Engineering Assignment.docx** â€“ Original assignment brief.  
- **tfplan** â€“ Terraform plan file (ignored in `.gitignore`).

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

1. Initialize providers and modules:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. Select the target environment (AWS or GCP):
   ```bash
   cd environments/aws   # or environments/gcp
   ```

3. Validate configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

4. Preview changes:
   ```bash
   terraform plan -out=tfplan
   ```

5. Apply infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply "tfplan"
   ```

## ðŸ”’ Security

- Secrets (like `mygcp-creds.json` and `tfplan`) are ignored from Git tracking.  
- IAM policies follow **least-privilege** best practices.  
- Encryption is applied at rest (DB, S3/GCS) and in transit (TLS, VPN).
